# DataWhys Content

This repository contains content for DataWhys in the form of JupyterLab notebooks (.ipynb files).

Any other content-related materials, e.g. spreadsheets, should be placed [in the OneDrive folder](https://livememphis-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/aolney_memphis_edu/Documents/DataWhys/content-planning?csf=1&e=LPEGbr). If you create an issue that references a document in that folder, please try to link to said document.

If you want to change/correct content, either create an issue describing your change or [use a `git` workflow to make the change](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request).
